## About
Read the comments for more information.<br>
This case works on the basis of a server worker, which is a connection between the browser and the browser server.<br>
You use a service worker to make your page accessible offline, to boost performance or for extra security.<br>
A service worker often goes hand in hand with a cache. This case uses static cache and dynamic cache. >br>
Static cache are files about url locations that are sent to the cache in advance, so can be accessed offline.<br>
Dynamic cache are often url locations visited online by the user and cached after visit for offline access.<br>
